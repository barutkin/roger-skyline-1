# /etc/httpd/modsecurity.d/activated_rules/408.conf
# Rules to mitigate a slow HTTP DoS attack.
# They identify when the Apache HTTP server triggers a 408 status code and track how many times this happened. The module keeps the data in IP-based persistent storage so it can be correlated across requests. If this event has happened more than 5 times in 60 seconds, subsequent requests from that IP address will be dropped for a given period of time.
